title: "Reversal and baselines"
description: "What an Automation wants once nothing claims its target: the values in onExit, the baseline recorded on the object before Reactor first touched it, or nothing at all."

## What "coming back" means

`onExit` declares the level an automation wants once nothing is holding the workload down. Omit it and Reactor restores the **baseline** — what the target was set to before it first claimed it, recorded on the target itself:

```sh
kubectl -n media get deploy qbittorrent -o jsonpath='{.metadata.annotations}'
# {"reactor.robbeverhelst.com/baseline-replicas":"1",
#  "reactor.robbeverhelst.com/claimed-by":"media/shed-on-battery",
#  "reactor.robbeverhelst.com/claimed-at":"2026-08-13T02:41:07Z"}
```

The baseline annotation is named for what it records, so a CronJob carries `baseline-suspend: "false"` rather than a replica count that would mean nothing there — `baseline-replicas` keeps meaning exactly one replica count, forever. Those annotations are how a workload explains itself at 3am, and they are removed the moment nothing claims it — after which Reactor asserts nothing and you can scale it by hand freely.

| `spec.reversal` | What the automation wants once nothing claims the target | Default when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Declared` | the values in `onExit` | `onExit` is set |
| `Baseline` | whatever the target was before Reactor first claimed it | `onExit` is omitted |
| `None` | nothing — leave it wherever it was left | never; opt in explicitly |

> **Upgrading from v0.3.0:** an automation with no `onExit` used to leave its workload scaled down permanently. It now restores the baseline instead. Set `reversal: None` to keep the old behaviour.

> **GitOps:** Reactor writes `spec.replicas` and the three annotations above onto target Deployments. If Flux or Argo CD manages those Deployments it will report drift and revert them. Exclude the fields on any workload you let Reactor act on — Argo CD `ignoreDifferences` on `/spec/replicas` and the `reactor.robbeverhelst.com` annotations, or a Flux `patch` with the same exclusions.
